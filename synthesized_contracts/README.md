# Synthesized Contracts Directory

This directory contains the synthesized smart contracts generated by the synthesis workflow.

## Directory Structure

```

```

## Usage

The synthesis workflow generates 5 candidate contracts for each benchmark and saves them in this directory structure. Each candidate is stored in its own subdirectory with a descriptive name.

## Report Format

The `synthesis_report.json` file contains:
- Benchmark name and timestamp
- Statistics (total candidates, average/best/worst passing rates)
- Detailed information about each candidate including:
  - Contract file path
  - Generation time
  - Trace file information
  - Passing rate

## Generated Contracts

Each generated contract includes:
- SPDX license identifier
- Solidity pragma statement
- Contract structure with state variables
- Constructor function
- Transaction functions with guards

## Trace Generation

Traces are generated using the `trace_generator.py` script (renamed from `tmp.py`):
- Supports both batch processing and single file processing
- Generates traces compatible with the updated parser
- Handles parameter formatting in `key=value` format
- Includes error handling for incorrect function names from synthesis

## Management

- Contracts are automatically saved here during synthesis
- Old contracts are overwritten when running synthesis again
- Use this directory to analyze and compare different synthesis results
- Trace generation is integrated into the synthesis workflow
