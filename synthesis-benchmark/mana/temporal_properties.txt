//Ensuring rate calculation is always within range box(initialRate(i) && endRate(e) && rate(p, r) -> e <= r <= i)
//Ensuring no negative total supply after finalization box(finalization() -> finalSupply(s) && s >= 0)
//Ensuring weiRaised increases properly box(buyTokens(p, w) -> weiRaised(r) && weiRaised(r + w))
//Ensuring buyTokens only occurs with nonzero beneficiary box(buyTokens(p, w) -> p ! == 0)
